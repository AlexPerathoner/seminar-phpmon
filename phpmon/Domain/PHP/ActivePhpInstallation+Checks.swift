     It is always possible that the system configuration for PHP-FPM has not been set up for Valet.
     This can occur when a user manually installs a new PHP version, but does not run `valet install`.
     In that case, we should alert the user!

     This method actively presents a modal if said checks fails, so don't call this method too many times.
