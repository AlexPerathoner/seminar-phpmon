 This generic async helper is something I'd like to use in more places.
 
 The `DispatchQueue.global` into `DispatchQueue.main.async` logic is common in the app.
 
 I could also use try `async` support which was introduced in Swift but that would
 require too much refactoring at this time to consider. I also need to read up on async
 in order to properly grasp all the gotchas. Looking into that later at some point.
