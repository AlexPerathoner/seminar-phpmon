# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PHP Monitor.

I consider this project a bit of a nice side-project to my daily gig, so it is very much a personal affair where I love to tinker around.

**While the code of the latest PHP Monitor release is public, many things are constantly in flux that may not be pushed to this repository yet.**

I don't mean to be rude, but I don't want other people involved with the project beyond simply contributing a few small things here and there, as has been the case in the past.

The extra mental overhead of having additional contributors to report to, whose code will need to be reviewed... it's a lot and it makes working on PHP Monitor less enjoyable for me. 

Plus, at this point, the majority of PHP Monitor's main functionality is also done.

As a result, I may refer you to this file at some point. Again, I don't wish to be rude, but this general rule stands:

**Making any changes in a fork and opening a pull request without opening an issue first will most likely result in your PR being closed without mercy.**

To repeat, I am **not opposed** to small contributions and fixes, if they are **meaningful or insightful**.

To learn more, please check out the [pull request template](/.github/pull_request_template.md) which contains more information about my contribution requirements. (This will also show up when you open a new PR.)

Thank you for respecting this!
